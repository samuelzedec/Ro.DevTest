# Rota das Oficinas Tecnical Test
This project is the template to be used to create a basic e-commerce Web API.
It already contains the basic structure of a API, that must be followed when adding more features.

Some caracteristics of this template that  are:

- Built using .NET 8.0
- Uses EntityFramework Core as it's ORM
- Follows the [CQRS Pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs) and [Repository Pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/infrastructure-persistence-layer-design)
- Uses PostgreSql as it's database engine
- Uses Xunit, Bogus and FluentAssertions to create tests

## To Dos in the Project
In the template there are some left unfinnished features that you must do to correctly create the API. Search **[TODO]**  to find theses features.

## Feel Free to Optimize or Refactor
If you find some code that you think can be enhanced, feel free to refactor it. But the refactor should follow the patterns of the project. Also the refactor should be separeted onn it's own commit.

## Creating a FrontEnd
When creating the frontend you can choose any framework you want, but your application must connect with the Web API via HTTP requests, and it's code must be in the same repository as the Web API.
